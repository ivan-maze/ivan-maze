Hi there ðŸ¤š

I am a technology enthusiast and an eternal curious. I`m totally passionate about my family, love music and problem solving!

I have developed my career through several technology areas and I finally reached the tipping point when I started to code.

Although I`m studing to become a full stack professional, I love back-end, low level programming, paradigm comcepts and machine learning.
