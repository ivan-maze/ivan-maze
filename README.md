# Hey there ðŸ¤š

I am a technology enthusiast and a curious learner.

I'm deeply passionate about my family, music, and engaging and solving complex problems.

My career has taken me through various areas of technology, and I found my tipping point when I started coding.

I am studying to become a full-stack but I love back-end, low-level programming, algorithms optimization and machine learning.
