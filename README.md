# Hi there ðŸ¤š

I am a technology enthusiast and a curious learner.

I'm deeply passionate about my family, love music, and enjoy solving complex problems.

My career has taken me through various areas of technology, and I found my tipping point when I started coding.

While I am studying to become a full-stack professional, I love back-end development, low-level programming, paradigms, algorithms optimization and machine learning.
