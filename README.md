# Hey there ðŸ¤š
# My name is Ivan...

I am studying to become a full-stack software engineer. I am driven by understanding how things work, identifying areas for improvement, and creating new things. I have experience in a variety of roles: working in sales on IoT projects at Endress+Hauser, focusing on cloud infrastructure and databases at Oracle, and I am currently part of Apple's hardware support team.

My areas of focus are back-end development, software architecture, microservices, and DevSecOps. I am also an enthusiast for Machine Learning and AI.

I'm passionate about reading, learning, solving problems, philosophy, and producing music. What I love most in the world is my wife and my son.

Some programming languages and technolgies I most use and study:
